How to update:
1. Find the desired commit in
   https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/third_party/freetype2/ .
   If such a commit does not yet exist, branch from the appropriate point with
   a branch name like "chromium/android/VER-X-X-X-updates" depending on the
   FreeType tag being branched and commit changes there.
2. Update BUILD.gn to reflect any changes.
3. Merge the new src/include/freetype/config/ftoption.h into
   include/freetype-custom-config/ftoption.h .
4. Merge the new src/include/freetype/config/ftconfig.h into
   include/freetype-custom-config/ftconfig.h .
5. Update this file.
6. Commit build changes while rolling Chromium's freetype DEPS to the
   new commit.

Most of the updating can be automated will roll-freetype.sh.
